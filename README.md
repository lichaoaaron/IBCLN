Introduction
---------------------------

Our main contributions are as follows:
1) We propose a new network architecture, a cascaded network, with loss components that achieves state-of-the-art quantitative results on real-world benchmarks for the single image reflection removal problem.  
2) We design a residual reconstruction loss, which can form a closed loop with the linear method for synthesizing images with reflections, to expand the influence of the synthesis method across the whole network.  
3) We collect a new real-world dataset containing images with densely-labeled ground-truth, which can serve as baseline data in future research. 



Requisites
-----------------------------

* PyTorch
  Use the instructions that are outlined on [PyTorch Homepage][2] for installing PyTorch for your operating system
* Python 3
* Linux
* CPU or NVIDIA GPU + CUDA CuDNN



<a name="someid"></a> Datasets and Designing the experiments
----------------------------------------------------------------

For the training data, we use 4000 images containing 2800 synthetic images and
1200 image patches of size 256 Ã— 256 from 290 real-world training images, containing 200 images from our created dataset and 90 images from [Zhang et al.][3].  For the testing data, we use five real-world datasets, including three sub-datasets from [SIR][4], [Zhang et al.][3] and our dataset [Nature][5].
