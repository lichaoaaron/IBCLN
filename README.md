Introduction
---------------------------

For single-image reflection removal (SIRR), researchers have observed that some handcrafted priors may help for distinguishing the transmission layer from the reflection layer in a single image. But these priors often do not generalize well to different types of reflections and scenes owing to disparate imaging conditions. In recent years, researchers apply data-driven learning to replace handcrafted priors via deep convolutional neural networks. With abundant labeled data, a network can be trained to perform effectively over a broad range of scenes. However, learning-based single image methods still have much room for improvement due to complications such as limited training data, disparate
imaging conditions, varying scene content, limited physical understanding of this problem, and the performance limitation of various models.

In this work, inspired by the iterative structure reduction approach for hidden community detection in social networks, we introduce a cascaded neural network model for transmission and reflection decomposition. To the best of our knowledge, previous works on reflection removal did not utilize a cascaded refinement approach.  

For a cascade model on SIRR, a simple approach is to employ one network to generate a predicted transmission that serves as the auxiliary information of the next network, and continue such process with subsequent networks to iteratively improve the prediction quality. With a long cascade, however, the training becomes difficult due to the  vanishing gradient problem and limited training guidance at each step. To address this issue, we design a convolutional LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network, which saves information from the previous iteration (i.e. time step) and allows gradients to flow unchanged.  

Our main contributions are as follows:

1) We propose a new network architecture, a cascaded network, with loss components that achieves state-of-the-art quantitative results on real-world benchmarks for the single image reflection removal problem. 

2) We design a residual reconstruction loss, which can form a closed loop with the linear method for synthesizing images with reflections, to expand the influence of the synthesis method across the whole network.  

3) We collect a new real-world dataset containing images with densely-labeled ground-truth, which can serve as baseline data in future research.
